Deck share and public-deck command failures now carry the transport failure too. A `deckShareCreate`, `deckShareList`, `deckShareDownload`, `deckShareListMine`, `deckShareRemove`, `deckListOtherUser`, `deckSetVisibility` or `deckDownloadPublic` that times out or cannot be sent passes its `CommandFailure` as the fourth argument of `ISessionResponse.commandFailed`, as the staff scopes already do. `deckShareCreate(params, requestId?)` echoes an optional client-only request id to `deckShareCreated` and `commandFailed`, so a caller can drop a cancelled request's late answer.
