# Datatrice instructions

Datatrice is the **Redux state package** for the Cockatrice ecosystem — slice definitions (`server`, `rooms`, `games`), the listener middleware, and the protobuf-message-to-action translation layer. Extracted from Webatrice and shipped as the `@cockatrice/datatrice` npm package.

Sibling to [Webatrice](https://github.com/seavor/Webatrice) (the React webclient, consumes the public store API) and [Sockatrice](https://github.com/seavor/Sockatrice) (the WebSocket transport, fires response callbacks into `attachResponseHandlers(store)`). Datatrice owns no UI and no socket — UI lives in Webatrice, transport lives in Sockatrice.

## Position in the Cockatrice ecosystem

Desktop Cockatrice is the reference implementation. When porting reducer behavior, read the desktop source as ground truth; do not re-derive the rule from documentation. The Webatrice parity mandate extends through this package — slice transitions must mirror desktop so a desktop player and a webclient player in the same Servatrice room see consistent game state.

## Public API surface

Four entry points (see [package.json](../../packages/datatrice/package.json) `exports`):

| Subpath | Contents |
|---|---|
| `@cockatrice/datatrice` | `createStore`, slice namespaces (`server`, `rooms`, `games`), `App`/`Data`/`Enriched` types, `common` utilities, `attachResponseHandlers` |
| `@cockatrice/datatrice/react` | `DatatriceProvider`, `WebClientProvider`, `WebClientContext`, typed `useAppSelector`/`useAppDispatch` |
| `@cockatrice/datatrice/types` | Type-only entry |
| `@cockatrice/datatrice/testing` | Redux state-shape fixture builders |

**Internal-only:** the per-scope `*ResponseImpl` classes (session / room / game / admin / moderator) in [src/api/](../../packages/datatrice/src/api/). Sockatrice fires response callbacks into the `IWebClientResponse` instance built by `attachResponseHandlers(store)`; consumers use `attachResponseHandlers` and never import the impl classes directly.

## Initialization order

**Listener-middleware singleton.** The `listenerMiddleware` exported from [src/store/listenerMiddleware.ts](../../packages/datatrice/src/store/listenerMiddleware.ts) is a module-scoped singleton, not a per-store instance. `createStore()` registers slice listeners against it via a `listenersRegistered` latch — without that guard, calling `createStore()` twice in the same process (test harnesses, hot reload) attaches every listener again and every matching action fires twice.

**Protobuf-aware serializable check.** Protobuf-es v2 messages are plain JS objects decorated with `$typeName` / `$unknown` siblings; their `bytes` fields surface as `Uint8Array` and `int64`/`uint64` as `BigInt`. The RTK `serializableCheck` rejects all four by default. [src/store/isSerializable.ts](../../packages/datatrice/src/store/isSerializable.ts) widens the predicate to accept proto messages, `Uint8Array`, and `BigInt`. `createStore()` ships with RTK's dev invariant middlewares (`serializableCheck` / `immutableCheck`) disabled — state and actions carry protobuf messages at server scale, and the O(state)-per-dispatch walks froze dev sessions on busy servers. `isSerializable` is no longer wired into the store; it remains exported for consumers that re-enable a scoped serializable check. The dev-mode guard the store does ship is [freezeMessagesMiddleware](../../packages/datatrice/src/store/freezeMessagesMiddleware.ts), which freezes protobuf messages at state entry so in-place mutation of a stored message throws instead of going stale — see [datatrice-store.instructions.md](datatrice-store.instructions.md#reducer-author-hazards).

## Layer boundaries

Enforced by [eslint.boundaries.mjs](../../packages/datatrice/eslint.boundaries.mjs):

- `slice → {common, types, slice}` — reducers and selectors are leaf layers
- `api → {common, types, slice, api, root}` — response impls dispatch into slices
- `react → {common, types, slice, api, root}` — providers wire the store
- `common → {common, types}` — shared utilities (normalizers, sort, `mergeSetFields`)
- `types → {types}` — leaf
- Spec files are exempt.

Other invariants:
- No React in slice files.
- No `getState()` outside the listener middleware.
- Listener middleware is a singleton; `createStore` wires it once per store instance.

## Protocol quirks

Servatrice protocol behaviors the data layer accommodates:

- **System-injected user messages can omit the username** (ban notifications targeting the current user, server announcements). [src/common/normalizers.ts](../../packages/datatrice/src/common/normalizers.ts) `normalizeUserMessage` preserves the omission as a no-op so the store always holds a clean string regardless of whether the server attributes the message to a user.

## Server capabilities

Webatrice must keep working against Servatrice 3.0.0 while Sockatrice speaks the 3.1 protocol. Servatrice advertises no feature list: `Event_ServerIdentification` carries `server_version`, `protocol_version` (14 on both releases, so it can't tell them apart) and only the `SupportsPasswordHash` option bit, and `Command_Login` feature negotiation runs one way (server-required client features). The server's version string, stored as `server.info.version`, is the one signal.

[server.capabilities.ts](../../packages/datatrice/src/store/server/server.capabilities.ts) maps it to named feature families (`ServerCapability.REPORTS`, `MODERATION_TOOLS`, `CARD_ART`, `PLAYMATS`, `DECK_SHARING`, `DEVELOPER_ROLE`). Gate 3.1-only UI with `server.Selectors.supports(state, ServerCapability.X)`; never compare version strings in components. Pre-release labels are ignored (`3.1.0-beta.N` counts as 3.1), and an unknown or unparseable version answers `false` so the action stays hidden rather than failing with `RespFunctionNotAllowed` / `RespInvalidCommand`. A new 3.x feature gets a new capability with its minimum version in `MIN_SERVER_VERSION`.

## Store performance invariants

**The live ping clock lives in `GamesState.pings`, not the game graph.** Servatrice broadcasts `Event_PlayerPropertiesChanged` carrying only `ping_seconds` ~1/s per seated player and spectator. Held inside the player graph, that volatile value flipped the game, players, and player references several times a second and re-rendered every subscriber. It is instead held in a sibling map keyed `[gameId][playerId]`, authoritative over the stale `properties.pingSeconds` snapshot on each player. Read it only via `Selectors.getPings` / `getPlayerPing`. A player-properties update whose set fields are all volatile (the ping clock plus the redundant `player_id`) routes to `state.pings` and skips the player clone/merge, so the tick stream flips no ref. Reducers assume `pings[gameId]` exists after `gameJoined`, so fixtures and preloaded/partial state must seed it; selectors `?.`-guard the partial case.
