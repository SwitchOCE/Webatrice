# Webatrice

The Cockatrice web client — a React/TypeScript SPA that connects to a Servatrice server over a WebSocket.

## Application Architecture

![Application Architecture](architecture/simple.png?raw=true "Application Architecture")

For the full set of diagrams (detailed layer map + command/response/event sequence) and the `npm run diagram` scripts that regenerate them, see [architecture/](architecture/). For prose — WebSocket layering, Redux store shape, test conventions — see [.github/instructions/root.instructions.md](.github/instructions/root.instructions.md).

## Stack

React 19 + TypeScript, built with [Vite](https://vite.dev/) 8. State via Redux Toolkit + RxJS, UI via MUI v9, tests via Vitest. Protobuf bindings come pre-built from the [`sockatrice`](https://github.com/seavor/Sockatrice) npm package as `sockatrice/generated`.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm

## Supported browsers

Current Chrome, Edge, Firefox and Safari: Chrome/Edge 111, Firefox 114 and Safari 16.4 (macOS and iOS) or newer, as
declared in `packages/webatrice/package.json` `browserslist` and matching the Vite build target. The e2e suite runs on
Chromium, Firefox and WebKit. The page must be served over `https://` (or from `localhost`): logging in hashes the
password with Web Crypto, which browsers expose only in secure contexts. At startup the app checks for the APIs it needs
and shows an "Unsupported Browser" screen naming what is missing instead of booting.

## Getting started

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

`npm install` initializes the `vendor/cockatrice` git submodule (sparse-checked-out to `libcockatrice_protocol/` for Sockatrice's proto generation) via the `prepare` hook. `servatrice.sql` no longer lives in the submodule — the e2e stack extracts it from the pinned `ghcr.io/cockatrice/servatrice` image at compose time. `npm start` runs Turborepo (`turbo run dev`), which builds the `@cockatrice/*` packages in dependency order, then boots the Vite dev server and opens a browser tab at [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) automatically (configured via `server.open` in `vite.config.ts`). The first start runs `prebuild.js` via webatrice's `predev` hook to merge i18n catalogs, so give it a moment.

## Scripts

### Dev & build

- `npm start` — build packages in dependency order + start the Vite dev server via Turborepo (`turbo run dev`; runs `prebuild.js` first via `predev`)
- `npm run build` — production build into `build/` (also runs the prebuild hooks)
- `npm run preview` — serve the built `build/` output locally to smoke-test a production build

### Tests

- `npm test` — one-shot Vitest run (unit specs)
- `npm run test:watch` — Vitest in watch mode
- `npm run test:integration` — integration specs via `vitest.integration.config.ts`
- `npm run test:coverage` / `npm run test:integration:coverage` — the above with v8 coverage

End-to-end tests live in the [Sockatrice](https://github.com/seavor/Sockatrice) repo, which vendors servatrice and runs the Playwright suite against a Webatrice dev server on `:5173`.

### Quality

- `npm run lint` / `npm run lint:fix` — ESLint over `src/`
- `npm run golden` — `lint` + `test` + `test:integration`; the fast CI-equivalent gate to run before declaring work done

### i18n

- `npm run translate` — re-run the i18n merge only (`prebuild.js -i18nOnly`)

## Generated files

Produced by `prebuild.js` on every `npm start` / `npm run build`. Don't edit them by hand:

| File | Tracked? | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `src/server-props.json` | Gitignored | Build metadata including the current git SHA. Written by `prebuild.js`; only appears after a first local run. |
| `src/images/countries/*.svg` | Gitignored | Country flag SVGs copied from `vendor/cockatrice/cockatrice/resources/countries/` (sparse-checkout from the Cockatrice submodule). Materialized by `prebuild.js`. |
| `src/i18n-default.json` | **Committed** | Merged i18n catalog. Regenerate with `npm run translate` and commit whenever it changes. |
