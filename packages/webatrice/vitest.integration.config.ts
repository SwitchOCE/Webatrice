// Integration test suite (`npm run test:integration` / `test:integration:coverage`).

// Purpose: exercise feature flows and command/event round-trips against a real
// Redux store and real Datatrice reducers, driven by protobuf payloads. Specs
// live in the top-level `integration/` tree as `integration/src/**/*.spec.{ts,tsx}`.
//
// Boundary: only the WebSocket *constructor* is mocked (see
// `integration/src/helpers/setup.ts`) — everything downstream of the socket is
// real. There is no real browser and no real Servatrice; tests needing those
// belong in the e2e suite (`playwright.config.ts`). This suite is not a
// superset of the unit suite — it deliberately exercises different paths.
