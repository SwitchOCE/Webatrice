/**
 * Local mock types for the ported fancy-webatrice PlayerBox.
 *
 * Fancy's PlayerBox reads from Supabase-backed types (`RoomMemberWithProfile`
 * from `@/lib/rooms`, `DeckCard` from `@/lib/decks`). Og doesn't have
 * those types — its data flows through Cockatrice protobuf via Redux.
 *
 * Rather than rewrite the whole PlayerBox to use Cockatrice types
 * (which is the future wiring work), we define the minimal shape of
 * what fancy actually reads. This lets us keep the port ~1:1 with
 * fancy's source while the wiring lives on placeholder mocks.
 *
 * Every field here is exactly what fancy's PlayerBox / LibrarySearchDialog
 * accesses on the Supabase rows. Anything unused was dropped.
