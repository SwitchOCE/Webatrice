/**
 * Cross-PlayerBox selection ownership singleton. Each PlayerBox owns
 * its own `selection` state, but only ONE box can hold a non-null
 * selection at a time — clicking / marqueeing anywhere else (own or
 * opponent) should clear the previous selection.
 *
 * Implementation: a module-level singleton subscribed to via
 * `useSyncExternalStore`. When a PlayerBox transitions to having a
 * selection, it claims ownership (`setSelectionOwner(playerId)`).
 * Other PlayerBoxes' effects notice the ownership change and drop
 * their own selection. Clicking empty space explicitly releases
 * ownership so previously-selected boxes clear.
 *
 * A React context would work too, but the tree of PlayerBoxes is
 * rendered inside several intermediate components (Battlefield,
 * GameBoardCell) and threading a provider is more plumbing than the
 * feature deserves. The singleton has no lifecycle concerns because
 * the whole game is torn down when the tab closes.
