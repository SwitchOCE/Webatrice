/**
 * Data and rule constants for edhpowerlevel-style bracket assessment.
 *
 * Every value in this file was extracted from edhpowerlevel.com's
 * client bundle (2026-07-20 snapshot) so the resulting bracket matches
 * their published verdict as closely as possible. Their algorithm is
 * the de-facto community standard for Commander bracket judgment even
 * though it differs from WotC's official guidelines in several places
 * (notably around what qualifies as an "early" combo).
 *
 * If they revise the algorithm, we need to refresh these constants —
 * there's no live API to fetch, and the client bundle they ship has
 * hashed filenames that rotate every deploy.
