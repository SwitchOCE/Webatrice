/**
 * Client-side registry for optimistic card mutations.
 *
 * Callers dispatch the intended state change immediately (so the UI
 * reflects it without waiting for the server round-trip), register the
 * rollback closure here, and hand the server-side wire call an
 * `onError` callback that invokes `rollbackOptimistic` if the server
 * rejects.
 *
 * The game listeners (`game.listeners.zones.ts`, `.cards.ts`) consult this
 * registry when the corresponding server event arrives — if a matching
 * pending op is present, the reducer dispatch is skipped for
 * non-idempotent state changes (specifically `cardMovedBetweenZones`,
 * which double-counts if applied twice). Idempotent reducers
 * (`cardFieldsUpdated`, `cardMovedInSameZone`) don't need dedup — the
 * server echo simply re-applies the same state.
 *
 * Deliberately module-scope rather than a Redux slice: pending-op
 * state is ephemeral client bookkeeping that never needs to be
 * persisted, replayed, or observed for reactivity. A plain Map is
 * simpler and cheaper than a slice + selectors + subscription plumbing.
